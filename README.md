![Dark black card with centered text "Editor" set in striking green](img/card.png)

A performant and simple plain text editor, created with Prosemirror. The design is very inpsired by Paco Coursey's ["Writer"](https://github.com/pacocoursey/writer).

To do:

- Fix sentence-wrapping bug where it overflows sometimes
- Basic markdown through Prosemirror marks. Don't remove formatting (WYSIWYG), just style it with the formatting.
- Potentially replace prosemirror-view to be more lightweight and integrate cursor and selection "natively".
- "Bookmarks" to leave your cursor in a position and travel back to.
